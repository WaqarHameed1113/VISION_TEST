In the second test, I had to configure the entire environment on my home laptop, which hadn't been used for professional purposes before. The setup encountered a conflict between the torchvision matplotlib and the Jupyter kernel, which was eventually resolved by creating a new environment with Python version 3.7.7. This process consumed a substantial amount of time. Additionally, the download and evaluation of multiple datasets added to the overall time investment.

Despite these challenges, I persevered and managed to initiate the training phase. After 25 epochs, the accuracy reached 73%, falling short of the desired level. However, considering historical trends, further training holds promise for improvement. With optimism, I believe that extending the training duration will likely result in achieving an accuracy of over 85%.
